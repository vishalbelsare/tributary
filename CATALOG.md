# Transforms
## Modulate
- Delay - Streaming wrapper to delay a stream
- Throttle - Streaming wrapper to only tick at most every interval
- Debounce - Streaming wrapper to only tick on new values
- Apply - Streaming wrapper to apply a function to an input stream
- Window - Streaming wrapper to collect a window of values
- Unroll - Streaming wrapper to unroll an iterable stream
- UnrollDataFrame - Streaming wrapper to unroll a dataframe into a stream
- Merge - Streaming wrapper to merge 2 inputs into a single output
- ListMerge - Streaming wrapper to merge 2 input lists into a single output list
- DictMerge - Streaming wrapper to merge 2 input dicts into a single output dict. Preference is given to the second input (e.g. if keys overlap)
- Reduce - Streaming wrapper to merge any number of inputs
- FixedMap - Map input stream to fixed number of outputs
- Subprocess - Open a subprocess and yield results as they come. Can also stream data to subprocess (either instantaneous or long-running subprocess)


## Calculations
Note that `tributary` can also be configured to operate on **dual numbers** for things like lazy or streaming autodifferentiation.
